# Track editor for MRSIM

## Made by Wesley 

### Lowkey not much works yet, pretty much just adding the gates, rotating them if you want, and exporting
### Adding the gate order will come once there is passage sensing for pipe gates

This is used to easily put together a track, convert to XML and test in the sim
All objects defined and added in objects.js 
Currently very very bad but has functionality. 

If you have better assets please let me know LOL


## To Run
cd into the directory and then
python -m http.server 8000
and then go to http://localhost:8000

## Installing Track Files
uh this is a wip rn, just ignore, if u want the tracks u can just download them from the discord

Tracks will be copied to `Documents/MRSIM/Tracks` on your system.
